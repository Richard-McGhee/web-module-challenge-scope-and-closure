 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * 
 * Counter 1 uses a closure to create a new private variable which allows it to be used with other variables and track seperately. Counter 2 simply increments without using a return or allowing you to increment seperately.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * 
 * Counter 1, because it uses a function after the first return to run a child function after the parent has terminated
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *
 * When multiple types of counters need to be used simultaneously. When there only needs to be 1 counter, for simplicity.
